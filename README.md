# Calm Collective Media Agency: Multi Agent Team with Autogen

## üìñ Introduction

An exploration into the possibilty of a fully autonomous Media Agency workforce using the [AutoGen library](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen). Instead of relying on a single agent to handle tasks, multiple specialized agents work together, each bringing its expertise to the table.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª AI Roles

The agents involved in the collaboration include:

1. **Project Manager**
    - Plans and manages the task provided.
    - Colloborates with the team to ensure smooth delivery of project.
2. **Creative Director**
    - Manages the creative output of the team.
3. **Art Director**
    - Reviews the output of the artist and provide feedback to improve on the artwork.
4. **Artist**
    - Create any artwork required for the project.
5. **Researcher**
    - Conducts research on a given subject, provides insight for the team.
    - Create research reports.
6. **Copywriter**
    - Create articles, short form or long form content.
7. **Domain Expert**
    - Provides domain knowledge of Calm Collective, past talks, articles and mental health resources.
8. **User Proxy**
    - Acts as an intermediary between the human user and the agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

1. Ensure required libraries are installed:

    {
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", #or whatever model you prefer
        "api_key": "INSERT_HERE"
    }
]
```

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX"
SERP_API_KEY="XXX"
BROWSERLESS_API_KEY="XXX"
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="XXX"
CHAINLIT_API_KEY="XXX"
```

4. Launch in CLI:

```

## üìà Roadmap

1. Refine workflow and data pass through to agents
2. Reduce unnecessaery back and forth
